# React MobX

A simple example of using [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) in a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) project.

Yes, it's another fucking Todo app.

## Usage

Install all dependencies by running `yarn`, then run `yarn dev` to build and run the application using [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/).

Additionally includes `yarn lint` task (using [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/ presets) because lint is bad.

## License

I dunno, whatever. Like most self-learning crap I shamelessly stole a lot of this from various places. Use at your own risk.
